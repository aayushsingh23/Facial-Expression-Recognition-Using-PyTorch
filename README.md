# Facial Expression Recognition with PyTorch

## Overview
This project implements a **Facial Expression Recognition** system using **PyTorch**. It trains a deep learning model to classify facial expressions from images.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle:
[Face Expression Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset)

It contains labeled images of human faces with different emotions.

## Installation
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy pandas
```

## Usage
Follow these steps to train and test the model:

1. **Load Dataset**
   - The dataset is preprocessed by resizing images and normalizing pixel values.

2. **Define Model**
   - A **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** is implemented using PyTorch to classify facial expressions.

3. **Training**
   - The model is trained using the dataset, utilizing loss functions like CrossEntropyLoss and an optimizer like Adam.

4. **Evaluation**
   - After training, the model is evaluated on test data to measure accuracy.

## Results
- The model achieves a reasonable accuracy in classifying facial expressions.
- Sample predictions are visualized using **matplotlib**.

## Future Improvements
- Fine-tuning the model architecture.
- Implementing data augmentation techniques.
- Experimenting with different optimizers and learning rate schedules.

## Credits
This project was implemented as a guided learning experience using **PyTorch**.
